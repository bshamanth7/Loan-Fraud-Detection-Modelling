The Small Business Administration (SBA), established in 1953, has been instrumental in aiding small businesses secure loans. These small businesses are a significant source of employment in the United States, and their growth contributes to economic development. The SBA assists these businesses by guaranteeing bank loans, reducing the risk for banks and encouraging them to lend to small businesses. In case of a loan default, the SBA covers the guaranteed amount, and the bank incurs a loss for the remaining balance.

Despite several success stories like FedEx and Apple, the default rate is quite high. Some economists argue that the banking market functions more efficiently without the SBA’s intervention. However, supporters contend that the social benefits and job creation outweigh the government’s financial costs from defaulted loans.

The data set in question originates from the U.S. SBA loan database. It contains historical data from 1987 through 2014, with 899,164 observations across 27 variables. This data includes information on whether the loan was fully paid off or if the SBA had to charge off any amount, and if so, how much. The utilized data set is a subset of the original one, focusing on loans related to the Real Estate and Rental and Leasing industry in California. This subset contains 2,102 observations and 35 variables. The ‘Default’ column, initially an integer of 1 or zero, was converted to a factor for analysis purposes.
