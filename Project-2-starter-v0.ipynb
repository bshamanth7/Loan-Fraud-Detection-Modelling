    "**Here are some tips for submitting your project. You can use the points as partial check list before submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Give your notebook a clear and descriptive title.** \n",
    "- **Explain your work in Markdown cells.** This will make your notebook easier to read and understand. You can use different colors of font to highlight important points.\n",
    "- **Remove any unnecessary code or text.** For example, you should not include the template for training and scoring in your final submission.\n",
    "- **Package your submission in a single file.** I will deduct points for multiple files or incorrect folder structure.\n",
    "- **Name your notebooks correctly.** Include your name and Net-ID in the file name.\n",
    "- **Train your TE/WOE encoders on the training set only.** You can train them on the full dataset for your final model.\n",
    "- **Test your scoring function.** Most students scoring functions in the past din't work, so make sure to test yours before submitting your project.\n",
    "- **Avoid common mistakes in your scoring function.** For example, your scoring function should not:\n",
    "  - drop records, expect the target to be passed - check that scoring function returns same number of records as in the validation dataset provided for testing\n",
    "  - fit TE/WOE/Scalers\n",
    "  - return anything other than a Pandas DF.\n",
    "- **Make sure you have the required number of engineered features.** \n",
    "- **Don't create features and then not use them in the model**, if there is a reason not to use the feature in the model, explain.\n",
    "- **Don't include models in your notebook that you didn't train.** This is considered cheating and will result in a grade of zero for the project.\n",
    "- **Consistently display model performance metrics.** Use AUC for all models and iterations, and don't switch between metrics. For sure don't use accuracy, it is misleading metric for the imbalanced datasets. \n",
    "- **Discuss your model results in a Markdown cell.** Don't just print the results; explain what they mean.\n",
    "- **Include a conclusion section in your notebook.** This is your chance to summarize your findings and discuss the implications of your work.\n",
    "- **Treat your notebook like a project report that will be read by your manager who can't read Python code.** Make sure your notebook is clear, concise, and easy to understand.\n",
    "- **Display a preview of your dataset that you used for training.** This will help me understand what features you used in your model.\n",
    "- **Use the libraries versions specified on eLearning.** For example, you should use H2O 3.42.0.2  \n",
    "- **Use Python 3.10.11.** If you use another version and your code doesn't work on 3.10.11, it will be considered a bug in your code.\n",
    "- **When running H2O and want to suppress long prints (for example model summary), include \";\" at the end of the command.**\n",
    "- **Don't include the dataset with your deliverables.** "

    "    - Encode replace missing values\n",

    "- Encode categorical variables\n",
    "- Split dataset to Train/Test/Validation. If you perform cross-validation while tuning hyper-parameters, you don't need validation dataset.\n",
    "- Add engineered features. Simple encoding (Target encoding) for individual feature doesn't count to the 10 required engineered features\n",
    "- Train and tune ML models\n",
    "- Provide final metrics using Test (hold-out) dataset:\n",
    "    - Metric to report and optimize for **AUC**\n",
    "    - Confusion matrix for best F1\n",
    "- Interpret final trained model using Test dataset:\n",
